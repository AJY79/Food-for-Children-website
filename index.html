        <h1>Food For Children Totnes CIC</h1>
        <p><b>We are a not for profit organisation supporting low income families during the school holidays with Meal Kits in place of school dinners.</b></p>
        <p class="p3">We rely solely on donations of food and money to support our families within our local community and you can find details of how to do both further down this page. Currently all schools within Totnes, Dartington and Berry Pomeroy have been contacted to offer our support and with more referrals coming in regularly it just shows how much of a need there is for help with over 100 Families being supported in our first year and during the cost of living crisis we find ourselves in at the moment. If you feel you could benefit from our help, please contact your childs school (if within the districts previously mentioned) and ask for a referral to us. Our process is simple, confidential and we try our hardest to accomodate all food intolerances and sensory issues within the limitations of the food types we're able to offer.</p>

          <p class="p3">Food For Children Totnes CIC was started in February 2023 to help out during the February Half Term. At the time, it was unknown if this was something that would become permenant and if there was a need for this support. However it very quickly became evident that there is most definetely a need and in July we were registered with Companies House and provided over 2000 meals within the first 12 months of operating.</p> 
          <p class="p3">Some schools do not have the facility to put things in their fridges and freezers to store until the families collect, therefore we are only able to offer ambient (tinned and longlife) foods to all families. This does however mean that we are able to take donations all year round and store them ready for delivery just before the schools finish for the holidays. Each term we run a different campaign of foods we are collecting so that there is as much variety within the meals we are able to offer as possible. We also like to include a treat depending on the holiday season coming up, ie pancake mix for February Half Term, Easter Eggs for the Easter Holidays etc. There are many ways in which you can help us to provide the meal kits for our families, whether that's buying the foods we need and dropping off at our collection point, purchasing through the Amazon Wishlist and having things delivered to us directly, donating money as a one-off through the links below or setting up a regular payment if you're able to, promoting our online presence to raise awareness, helping to pack the parcels, or helping to deliver them to schools. However you choose to help, please know that we and all the families truly appreciate you and your kindness.

                <p>As there are 2 weeks in the Easter holidays we will be providing 4 meals for each child, breakfast for each weekday, squash/Juice and hopefully an Easter Egg for each child. So if you're in a position to help with any of these then that would be truly amazing and you can find a list of our current requests either on the Amazon link or further down this post. Drop off Point is 1 Whiteley Avenue, Totnes, TQ9 5FQ or alternatively message us to arrange collection. Thank you so much for your help with this.</p>
